## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Round 1 — initial QTFF demuxer.
  - Atom walker over QTFF `[size:4][type:4]([ext_size:8])?[payload]`
    with `size==1` (extended 64-bit) and `size==0` (to-end-of-file)
    special cases.
  - `ftyp` brand detection (recognises `qt  ` major / compatible).
  - `moov` walk covering `mvhd`, per-track `tkhd`, `mdia/mdhd`,
    `mdia/hdlr`, and `minf/stbl/{stsd,stts,stsc,stsz,stco|co64,stss}`.
  - Sample iterator yielding `(index, file_offset, size, dts,
    duration, sample_description_id, keyframe)` records.
  - `oxideav_core::Demuxer` trait impl emitting `Packet` records.
  - `oxideav_core::register!("mov", ...)` entry point and
    `register_containers(&mut ContainerRegistry)` factory.
  - Default-on `registry` cargo feature (drop `oxideav-core` with
    `default-features = false`).
  - Hand-built minimal QTFF integration test (`synth_minimal_qt.rs`):
    1-track 1-sample movie with `qt  ` brand, `rle ` sample format,
    320×240 frame.
